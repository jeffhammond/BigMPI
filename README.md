Build Status
============

We are still struggling to get Travis working properly.  Right now, only MPICH on Linux is tested and with an artificially low `INT_MAX` (1048576).

BigMPI
======

_See the ExaMPI14 [paper](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2690884) 
([free copy](https://github.com/jeffhammond/BigMPI-paper))
for a detailed analysis of large-count issues in MPI._

Interface to MPI for large messages, i.e. those where the count argument
exceeds `INT_MAX` but is still less than `SIZE_MAX`.
BigMPI is designed for the common case where one has a 64b address
space and is unable to do MPI communication on more than 2^31 elements
despite having sufficient memory to allocate such buffers.
BigMPI does not attempt to support large-counts on systems where
C `int` and `void*` are both 32b.

## Motivation

The MPI standard provides a wide range of communication functions that
take a C `int` argument for the element count, thereby limiting this
value to `INT_MAX` or less.
This means that one cannot send, e.g. 3 billion bytes using the `MPI_BYTE`
datatype, or a vector of 5 billion integers using the `MPI_INT` type, as
two examples.
There is a natural workaround using MPI derived datatypes, but this is
a burden on users who today may not be using derived datatypes.

This project aspires to make it as easy as possible to support arbitrarily
large counts (2^63 elements exceeds the local storage compacity of computers
for the foreseeable future).

This is an example of the code change required to support large counts using
BigMPI:
```
#ifdef BIGMPI
    MPIX_Bcast_x(stuff, large_count /* MPI_Count */, MPI_BYTE, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD);
#else // cannot use count>INT_MAX
    MPI_Bcast(stuff, not_large_count /* int */, MPI_BYTE, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD);
#endif
```

## Interface

The API follows the pattern of `MPI_Type_size(_x)` in that all BigMPI
functions are identical to their corresponding MPI ones except that
they end with `_x` to indicate that the count arguments have the type
`MPI_Count` instead of `int`.
BigMPI functions use the MPIX namespace because they are not in the
MPI standard.

## Limitations

Even though `MPI_Count` might be 128b, BigMPI only supports
64b counts (because of `MPI_Aint` limitations and a desire to use `size_t`
in unit tests), so BigMPI is not going to solve your problem if you
want to communicate more than 8 EiB of data in a single message.
Such computers do not exist nor is it likely that they will exist
in the foreseeable future.

BigMPI only supports built-in datatypes.  If you are already using
derived-datatypes, then you should already be able to handle large
counts without BigMPI.

Support for `MPI_IN_PLACE` is not implemented in some cases and
implemented inefficiently in others.
Using `MPI_IN_PLACE` is discouraged at the present time.
We hope to support it more effectively in the future.

BigMPI requires C99.  If your compiler does not support C99, get a
new compiler.

BigMPI only has C bindings right now.
Fortran 2003 bindings are planned.
If C++ bindings are important to you, please create an issue for this.

## Supported Functions

I believe that point-to-point, one-sided, broadcast and reductions
are the only functions worth supporting but I added some of the other
collectives anyways.
The v-collectives require a point-to-point implementation, but
we do not believe this causes a significant loss of performance.

## Technical details

[MPIX_Type_contiguous_x](https://github.com/jeffhammond/BigMPI/blob/master/src/type_contiguous_x.c)
does the heavy lifting.  It's pretty obvious how it works.
The datatypes engine will turn this into a contiguous datatype internally 
and thus the underlying communication will be efficient.  
MPI implementations need to be count-safe for this to work, but they need
to be count-safe period if the Forum is serious about datatypes being
the solution rather than `MPI_Count` everywhere.

All of the communication functions follow the same pattern, which is
clearly seen in [MPIX_Send_x](https://github.com/jeffhammond/BigMPI/blob/master/src/sendrecv_x.c).
I've optimized for the common case when count is smaller than 2^31 
with a `likely_if` macro to minimize the performance hit of BigMPI
for this more common use case
(hopefully so that users don't insert a branch for this themselves)

The most obvious optimization I can see doing is to implement
`MPIX_Type_contiguous_x` using internals of the MPI implementation 
instead of calling six MPI datatype functions.
I have started implemented this in MPICH already:
